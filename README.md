# IPC_Insight

This project involves developing an application that predicts relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on crime narratives provided by users.The application aims to assist legal professionals and law enforcement agencies by automatically identifying the applicable IPC sections from textual or audio inputs describing crime incidents. The application uses vector embeddings to represent crime narratives in a high-dimensional vector space, enabling efficient and accurate analysis. ChromaDB is employed as the vector database, providing optimized storage and retrieval of these embeddings, ensuring scalability and fast processing times.

# Techstack Used: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Python,Flask,MongoDB and ChromaDB
